Description of the Data:

We have gathered data from the IRS on Non-Profits Tax Information for Calendar Years  2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. The downloaded data represents
the 990 forms which the Non-Profits have filed to claim their tax exemptions. Non-Profits which file 990's include tax exempt organizations which are not private
foundations and have more than $200,000 in gross receipts or total assets more than $500,000. Private foundations and smaller non-profits file separate tax documents not
not included in this data set.

While we have downloaded four years worth of data, we have kept Calendar Year 2015 in reserve for validation. Our goal is to predict Non-Profits which will experience
the most drastic negative percent change in revenue for the next year since we assume these organizations will be more likely to have difficulty in providing the same
level of service they have done in prior years.

Combining Our Datasets:
The organizations which file their taxes vary each year. Unfortunately, the datasets for each year contain duplicated values on the Employer Identification Number. These are likely data entry errors of some kind.
Because we link years with EIN number, and our dependent variable is a the percentage change in revenue between years, all duplicated
values had to be dropped since the label for these observations would be ambigious.

2012 total records: 294,019     unique records: 265473       percentage dropped: 9.7%
2013 records filed: 289,603     unique records: 266089       percentage dropped: 8.1%
2014 records filed: 299,405     unique records: 274263       percentage dropped: 8.4%

We combined these records on EIN to create longitudinal dataset. After linking records and dropping records which are missing a total revenue or who have non-positive values for either 2012, 2013, or 2014
the remaining observations were 205,578 or about 77.4% of the original unique observations from 2012.

Absolute Variation in Total Revenue Changes:

For the years we have observed, the median change in revenue is slightly positive. However, the standard deviation for the change in the two year time period from 2012 to 2014 is
more than $20 million dollars which is more than 30 times the average total revenue of an organization. Although, there are large outliers in positive and negative changes in revenue,
overall the skew is high in the positive direction.

Percentile Variation in Total Revenue Changes:

The average percentile change in revenue for each year is slightly positive 2.1% on average which is a little more than inflation. Percentile changes in revenue
are greater in the two year time period on average 4.6% - which indicates that revenue trends between years are correlated.

Revenue changes in the bottom 40% are negative. Since we are concerned with the organizations who are experiencing the largest downward changes in revenue - we are most concerned
with organizations in the bottom 10%. On average for a one year time period that represents a -28.3% decrease in revenue and on a two year time frame
that represents a -33.7% decrease.
